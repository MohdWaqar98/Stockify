### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, youâ€™ll need:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.
- [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) installed in VS Code.

### Setup and Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stockify-landing-page.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd stockify-landing-page
   ```

3. **Run the Tailwind CSS build tool:**

   Before running the live server, ensure Tailwind CSS is compiled by running the following command:
